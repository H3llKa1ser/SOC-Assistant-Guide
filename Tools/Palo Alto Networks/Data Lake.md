# Palo Alto Networks Data Lake

## Explore function

### Usage case: Further investigation if XDR does not give enough context.

#### Explore tabs:

#### 1) Firewall

#### 2) Common

#### 3) Endpoints

### TIP: You can filter logs based in the columns (Severity, subtype, threat name, etc) or also download the PCAP file for more granular analysis (Firewall logs)

### In our queries, we can use operators like AND OR NOT LIKE and also use wildcards like %example% (%) 

### We can choose a timeframe from up to 90 days (depends on organizational log retention policy)

### We can search for activity based on source/destination IP address

### We can further narrow our searches down further by searching based on source/destination port, command line, hostname, timeframe, log source, etc
