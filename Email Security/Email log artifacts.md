### An email gateway log, contains these fields:

#### 1) SMTP Server IP: SMTP server IP used by a sender to send an email to a recipient. Use it to observe any spoofing presence as well as if it is blacklisted.

#### 2) Sender email address: Use it to check if it is from a blacklisted domain, as well as for spoofing attempts.

#### 3) Recipient email address: Use it to scope petentially infected machines and users in case of a cyber incident.

#### 4) Email Subject: Describes the content of the message or its purpose. Attackers use psychological tactics to substantially increase the chance of the potential victims interact with the content. For instance, attackers may use phrases to induce stress to the recipient such as: "Urgent Action Required, Unauthorized Access Attempt, Confirm your account Details, etc", which means, this kind of attack is based mostly on the psychological factor as a result, even experienced professionals might have a bad day and accidentally interact with the content (that includes cybersecurity professionals too!!!)
