## Tools: VirusTotal, MxToolbox, Search Engines

### Investigate the true origins of an email sender domain and SMTP server IP with these tools above.

### If the tools return results that the domain and the IP are blacklisted by some solutions and/or have bad reputation, there is a good chance that the domain and the IP are actually malicious.

## Email sender behavior analysis

### If somehow, the email sender domain and the SMTP server are not blacklisted and the domain has not been spoofed, you can check the sender behavior by doing the following:

#### 1) Have the recipient/s received emails from the email sender or its domain before? If yes, this behavior could be considered normal.

#### 2) Does the sender use the same subject formula to several recipients with his sent emails? If yes, there is a high chance that it is either a phishing campaign, or spam emails to the recipients.

#### 3) Is the mail subject relevant to the recipient's job duties (example)? If not, then there might be an indicator of spam or phishing email.
