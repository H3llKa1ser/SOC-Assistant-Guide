#### Like windows, services can be set up in linux that will start and run in the background after every system boot.

## .bashrc

#### When a bash shell is spawned, it runs commands stored in the .bashrc file.

#### This file can be considered as a startup list of actions to be performed. Hence it can prove to be a good place to look for presistence.
