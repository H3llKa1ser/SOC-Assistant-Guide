# YET ANOTHER RIDICULOUS ACRONYM (YARA)

### YARA can identify information based on both binary and textual patterns, such as hexadecimal and strings contained within a file.

## YARA RULES

### Can be used to determine if a file is malicious or not.

### Example: Search bitcoin wallets in strings for ransomware. Or search IPs for a Command and Control Server.

### File extension: .yar

### It's essentially the basics of programming to effectively create YARA rules.

### KEYWORDS:
