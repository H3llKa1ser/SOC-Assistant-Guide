# DIAMOND MODEL

### It's composed of 4 core features:

#### 1) Adversary

#### 2) Infrastructure

#### 3) Capability

#### 4) Victim

### It also establishes the atomic element of any intrusion activity.

### The model provides various opportunities to integrate intelligence in real-time for network defence, automating correlation across events, classifying events with confidence into adversary campaigns and forecasting adversary operations while planning and gaining mitigation strategies.

## ADVERSARY

#### Adversary Operator: Hacker or person intruding

#### Adversary Customer: 3rd party that benefis from the intrusion (might be the hacker as well)

## VICTIM

#### Victim Personae: People and organizations

#### Victim Assets: Attack surface (systems, hosts, IPs, etc.)

## CAPABILITY = TTPs

#### Capability capacity: Vulnerabilities and exposures

#### Adversary Arsemnal: Tools and skills

## INFRASTRUCTURE = Software/Hardware

#### Type 1: Controlled or owned by the adversary (Botnets)

#### Type 2: Compromised machines

#### Service providers: ISPs, domain registrars, webmail providers

## EVENT META FEATURES

#### 1) Timestamp (Different timezones)

#### 2) Phases (It may follow frameworks like Cyber kill chain)

#### 3) Result (Violates the CIA Triad)

#### 4) Direction (Infrastructure-to-Victim, Victim-to-Infra, Infra-to-Infra, Adversary-to-Infra, Infra-to-Adversary, Bidirectional, Unknown)

#### 5) Methodology

#### 6) Resources (Software, Knowledge, Information, Hardware, Funds, Facilities, Access)

## SOCIAL-POLITICAL COMPONENT

### Describe the needs and intent of the adversary.

### Example: Financial gain, Hacktivism, Espionage, acceptance in the hacker community

## TECHNOLOGY COMPONENT

### Highlights the relationship between the core features: Capability and Infrastructure.

### The capability and infrastructure decribe how the adversary operates and communicates.
