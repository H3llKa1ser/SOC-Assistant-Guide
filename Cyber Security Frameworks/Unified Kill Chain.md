### An improved and more detailed version of the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain Framework that comprises of 18 phases i total.

# PHASES

## INITIAL FOOTHOLD (COMPROMISED SYSTEM)

### 1) Reconnaissance (OSINT, Network Scanners, vulnerability scanners, etc.)

### 2) Weaponization (C2 Infrastructure)

### 3) Delivery (Visual Basic Macro)

### 4) Social Engineering (Spearphishing)

### 5) Exploitation ( Public CVE exploits, zero-day exploit)

### 6) Persistence (Webshells, registry keys, droppers, backdoors)

### 7) Defense Evasion ( Firewalls, Antivirus, IDS)

### 8) Command & Control (C2 Beaconing, DNS Tunneling, HTTP/HTTPS)

### 9) Pivoting (Internal Access) *This is the point where the first and second big parts of the UKC framework intertwine.

## NETWORK PROPAGATION (INTERNAL NETWORK)

### 10) Discovery (Bloodhound, Powerview)

### 11) Privilege Escalation (Misconfigurations, vulnerabilities)

### 12) Execution (Remote trojans, C2 Scripts, malicious links, scheduled tasks)

### 13) Credential Access (Mimikatz, Kekeo)

### 14) Lateral Movement

## ACTION ON OBJECTIVES (CRITICAL ASSET ACCESS)

### 15) Collection (Drives, browsers, audio, email, video, etc.)

### 16) Exfiltration (DNS Traffic, ICMP Traffic, HTTP/HTTPS Traffic)

### 17) Impact (Disk wipe, ransomware, DDoS)

### 18) Objectives (Database steal then sell to 3rd party)

#### The UKC framework compliments and supports most cybersecurity frameworks as it can be integrated with almost all of them (E.g.: MITRE ATT&CK Mmatrix, Cyber Kill Chain Framework, etc.)
