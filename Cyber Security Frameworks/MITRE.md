# ATT&CK Matrix

#### Used by both blue and red teams.

### MITRE ATT&CK Navigator: Can be used to visualize data by visiting either group or tool pages

# CAR

#### Can be used to gain intel for threats and how to detect and remediate them.

#### The intel it uses is from the ATT&CK Matrix

# ENGAGE

#### Essentially, it's a framework that does threat modelling. Its model is called Engage Matrix

## ENGAGE MATRIX

### Categories:

#### 1) Prepare the set of operational actions that will lead to your desired outcome. (Input)

#### 2) Expose adversaries when they trigger your deployed deception activities.

#### 3) Affect adversaries by performing actions that will have a negative impact on their operations.

#### 4) Elicit information by observing the adversary and learn more about their modus operandi. (TTPs)

#### 5) Understand the outcomes of the operational actions. (Output)

# D3FEND

### It is developed by the NSA. Still in BETA as the time of writing.

### It provides information on techniques:

#### 1) What is the technique (Definition)

#### 2) How the technique works

#### 3) Things to think about when implementing the technique (Considerations)

#### 4) How to utilize the technique (Example)

#### We can filter based on the ATT&CK Matrix

# ATT&CK EMULATION PLANS

#### Basically, it has recorded the entire operational security of groups so both blue and red teamers can fully emulate them to understand the OPSEC flow
