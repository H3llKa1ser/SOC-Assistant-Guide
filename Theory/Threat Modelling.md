# DEFINITION

### A series of steps to ultimately improve the security of a system.

### Therat modelling is about identifying risk and essentially boils down to:

#### 1) Identifying what systems and applications need to be secured and what function they serve in the environment

#### 2) Assessing what vulnerabilities and weknesses these systems and applications may have and how they could be potentially explited

#### 3) Creating a plan of action to secure these systems and applications from the vulnerabilities highlighted

#### 4) Putting in policies to prevent those vulnerabilities from occuring again where possible

### Threat modelling frameworks:

### STRIDE, DREAD, CUSS, etc.
